    <h2>For two consecutive years, TikTok has dominated the ranking of the most downloaded applications in the world.</h2>
    <p class="article">TikTok is once again the most downloaded application in the world between January and March 2022, according to a Sensor Tower report relayed by Phonandroid. The Chinese social network entered this ranking in 2020, rising to the top in just a few months. This first place was then confirmed in 2021. The site even became the most visited domain name in the world that year, ahead of Google.</p>

    <em>A top 4 shared between TikTokâ€¦ and Meta</em>

    <p class="article">The application thus remains the only software in the world's top 4 that does not belong to Meta, the group behind Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. These applications are respectively second, third and fourth in the ranking of those that have been the most downloaded in the world, App Store and Google Play combined. Then comes Telegram, the alternative messaging application to WhatsApp.</p>
    <p class="article">This ranking remains the same in Europe and the United States, with TikTok in first place and the three Meta applications behind. However, the situation is different in Asia, where Instagram and Facebook are ahead of TikTok, although this social network is Chinese. In the world ranking, the Snapchat and Messenger applications come in seventh and eighth positions. The ranking is then completed by Spotify (10th), Netflix (14th), Youtube (15th), Twitter (16th) and Amazon (17th).
